        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>

         <!-- Todo: In the future move OvalDraw to week 3. Leave OvalDraw Plus in week 4. -->
        <p><em>Welcome to Week 4.</em> We have covered a lot of material in the first three weeks. I suspect that last week’s 
        FaceDraw programming assignment was challenging. As we near the halfway point of our session, we will continue to focus 
        on delivering real code each week. This week we will continue with enhancing our ability to develop sophisticated 
        interactive Views while also learning how to enhance our Model to read and write from files. </p>
        <p>We will keep our live discussion/lecture session on Wednesday at 2:30pm CST this week 
            <a href="live-lecture.html" target="_blank">[join.me]</a>.</p>
        <p>Our activities list for this week is provided below. I am listing them in the order I think will be the most 
            beneficial for you to work through the topics.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review this week's Assignment in BlackBoard. Be very careful not to accidentally submit the Assignment until 
                you have completed all of the questions. You can complete it again; however, will have to re-enter all of the 
                questions.</li>
            <li>Take one more look at our "How to Be a Success Programmer" suggestions and consider any changes that you would 
                like to make after last week's FaceDraw assignment 
                <a href="successful-programmer.html" target="_blank">[link]</a></li>
            <li>Utilize your Git client to pull (or clone) our sample code repository by executing "git clone 
                https://github.com/EricJPogue/object-oriented-programming.git" command from you command shell.</li>
            <li>Lab: Complete the Java <em>MosaicLite</em> tutorial
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-mosaic-lite.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a>. Note that the souce code utilized in this tutorial is available in the "MosaicLite" 
                folder of the repository that you cloned above. ~1.5 hours</li>
            <li>Compete the Mosiac assignment. I anticipate that our Mosaic assignment will be of similar difficulty to FaceDraw. 
                Maybe a little bit easier because you are already a better Java developer than you were last week. I expect the 
                project will take you 8 to 10 hours to complete. If it takes you significantly longer (or shorter), I would be 
                interested in your feedback on how we could improve the assignment.</li>
            <li><em>Participate in the live discussion/lecture on Wednesday at 2:30pm CST</em> which will include lecture material
                plus an interactive lab where we will deliver OvalDraw Plus ActionListeners together. 
                 <a href="https://recordings.join.me/eL7cDCk_HUKJfMNK-yldoA" target="_blank">[recording]</a> ~1.5 hours</li>
            <li>Review the answers from last week's assignment. </li>
            <li>Lab: OvalDraw Plus Menus and Colors <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-ovaldraw-plus.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a> ~1.5 hours.</li>
            <li>Complete your Discussion Board (DB) post by Thursday evening.</li> 
            <li>Review the Java file documentation  
                <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/package-summary.html" target="_blank">[link]</a>
                provide by Oracle, and also review the related tutorials
                 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/" target="_blank">[link]</a></li>
            <li>Review the BMI with JavaDoc and Scanner (keyboard input) turtorial 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/bmi-calculator-add-javadoc-and-keyboard-input.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a>.
            <li>Review and comment on at least one of your classmates DB post by Sunday evening.</li>
            <li><em>Complete and Submit this week's Assignment</em> by Sunday evening (11:59pm). ~1 hour</li> 
            <li>Give yourself a special reward at the end of the week as you hava made it to the halfway point!</li>
        </ol> 
        <p>Feel free to send me an email or to post something in our "Class Forum" discussion board forum if you have any 
            questions or have any issues accessing the above content. Also, be watching for Announcements through Blackboard 
            during the week as I am sure that something will come up.</p>  
        <p>Good luck… and please let me know if something does not look right or if you are having difficulties.</p>

        <p><em>Welcome to Week 3.</em> We have covered a lot in the first two weeks. Much of it was preparing us for our first
        substantial programming assignment. I believe we are ready to apply what we have learned to our FaceDraw project. 
        Be sure to get an early start on the project and stay focused. You will note that there are fewer items on our 
        activities list this week. That is because you will need to focus your time and energy on FaceDraw.</p>
        <p>On important change this week. Based on popular demand I am moving our <em>Wednesday live discussion/lecture session
            to 2:30pm CST</em> this week. Please make every effort to join us. 
            <a href="live-lecture.html" target="_blank">[join.me]</a>.</p>
        <p>Our activities list for this week is provided below. I am listing them in the order I think will be the most 
            beneficial for you to work through the topics. I am also including a copy of our previous assignments at the end 
            of the document.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review this week's Assignment in BlackBoard. Be very careful not to accidentally submit the Assignment until 
                you have completed all of the questions. If you do accidentally submit the assignment, you can complete it 
                again, but will have to re-enter all of the questions.</li>
            <li>Review last week's assignment. Note that many of the same topics will come up in the future so it is more 
                important that you understand the concepts than that you got a given question correct.</li>
            <li>Analyze and commit to adopting the "How to Be a Success Programmer" suggestions that you feel are the most 
                important 
                <a href="successful-programmer.html" target="_blank">[link]</a></li>
            <li><em>FaceDraw, FaceDraw, FaceDraw</em>... I anticipate that the FaceDraw project will take you 8 to 12 hours 
                to complete. If it takes you significantly more time to complete, I would be interested in your feedback 
                on how we could improve the assignment.</li>
            <li>Utilize your Git client to clone our sample code repository by executing "git clone 
                https://github.com/EricJPogue/object-oriented-programming.git" command from you command shell. You will want 
                to clone the repository to a convenient location on your computer where you keep you source code. You will also 
                want to pull the repository regularly by utilizing the "git pull" command in order to get any new or updated 
                code.</li>
            <li>Lab: Complete the Java <em>FaceDrawLite</em> tutorial
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-facedraw-lite.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a>. Note that the souce code utilized in this tutorial is available in the "FaceDrawLite" folder
                of the repository that you cloned above. ~1.5 hours
            <li><em>Participate in the live discussion/lecture on Wednesday at 2:30pm CST</em>
                <a href="live-lecture.html" target="_blank">[join.me]</a> 
                and/or review the recording  
                <a href="https://recordings.join.me/jXvE_snx0k-KFCScCVfIyA" target="_blank">[recording]</a> 
                 ~1 hour</li>
            <li>Complete your Discussion Board (DB) post by Thursday evening. This a change from previous weeks as I am 
                trying to become more consistent with other Lewis University online classes.</li> 
            <li>Review "Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) in Java" lesson 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-gui-programming.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a> ~1 hour</li>
            <li>Review and comment on at least one of your classmates DB post by Sunday evening.</li>
            <li><em>Complete and Submit this week's Assignment</em> by Sunday evening (11:59pm). ~1 hour</li> 
            <li>Take time and reward yourself.</li>
        </ol>

         <!-- Todo: In the future add something that reviews the creation of ShapesLibray.java. -->
        <p><em>Welcome to Week 2.</em> We covered a lot of material in Week 1. However, we didn’t get a chance to write much code. This 
            week get your Java compilers out. We are going to start practicing some of the concepts we learned. </p>
        <p>Once again please make every effort to join our <em>live discussion/lecture on Wednesday at noon </em>
            <a href="live-lecture.html" target="_blank">[join.me]</a>. Grab your lunch and join us even if you can only stay for a 
            portion of the time. I am looking forward to spending some time with you.</p>
        <p>Our activities list for this week is provided below. Once again, I am listing them in the order I think will be the most 
            beneficial for you to work through the topics. Note that I am also including a copy of our previous assignments at the end 
            of this document.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review Assignment 2 which is located under the "Assignments" menu item in BlackBoard. Once again, I suggest going 
                through the assignment in its entirety at the start of the week as it will give you significant insight into 
                where to focus your energy and into which topics I feel are most important. I would also suggest completing the 
                questions in the Assignment throughout the week as the answers can be saved. However, be <em>very</em> careful 
                not to accidentally submit the Assignment until you have completed all of the questions. If you do accidentally 
                submit the assignment, you can complete it again, but will have to re-enter <em>all</em> of the questions.</li>
            <li>Lab: If you do not already have a favorite source code editor, please install Visual Studio Code. Note that I would 
                <em>not</em> recommend using a generic text editor like "Notepad" for this class. Installing Chrome as your 
                browser is recommended but optional
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/environment-configuration/mscode-and-chrome-windows10-setup.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a>
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">[download]</a></li>
            <li>Lab: Install the Java development environment 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/environment-configuration/java-jdk-windows10-setup.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li>Review the answers from last week's Assignment 1. Note that many of the same topics will come up in future assignments
                either directly or indirectly so it is more important that you understand the concepts than that you got a given 
                question correct.</li>
            <li>Lab: Complete the Java "Hello World" tutorial. As in <em>all</em> labs, you should follow along and complete the steps 
                yourself. As you go through the lab, you should make the resulting application uniquely you own by adding 
                standard comments at the top application (i.e. your name), changing the names of variables, adding small 
                features, etc. Finally, be sure to keep your unique lab creation as I will often be asking you to submit it as 
                part of your assignment. 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-hello-world.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li>Complete the tutorial from last week's "Bonus Discussion &amp; Lecture" session by Wednesday noon
                <a href="https://recordings.join.me/jyB6PEFKGUSYgYTjnNJhlg" target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li>Participate in the live discussion/lecture on Wednesday at noon 
                <a href="live-lecture.html" target="_blank">[join.me]</a> 
                and/or review the recording that will be linked here once it is available 
                <a href="https://recordings.join.me/9THgnnQGPEy5WrNA18KSbw" target="_blank">[recording]</a> 
                 ~2-3 hours</li>
            <li>Review "Introduction to Scrum in 7 Minutes" video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TycLR0TqFA" 
                target="_blank">[link]</a></li>
            <li>Lab: Complete the Java "Shapes Step 1" tutorial. Once again as will all labs, be sure to follow along and 
                complete the steps yourself, to make the resulting application uniquely your own, and to be ready to submit 
                your version of the application as part of an Assignment. 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-shapes-step1.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a></li> 
            <li>Complete your Discussion Board (DB) post by Wednesday evening.</li> 
            <li>Lab: Complete the Java "Shapes Step 2" tutorial. Once againg as will all labs, be sure to follow along and 
                complete the steps yourself, to make the resulting application uniquely your own, and to be ready to submit 
                your version of the application as part of an Assignment. 
                <a href="https://mediaatoz.blob.core.windows.net/object-oriented-programming/java-shapes-step2.mp4" 
                target="_blank">[video]</a></li>
            <li>Read and Understand the article “What is JSON? JavaScript Object Notation explained” 
                 <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3222851/javascript/what-is-json-javascript-object-notation-explained.html" 
                target="_blank">[link]</a></li> 
            <li>Read and Understand “JSON Introduction” from W3C 
                 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp" target="_blank">[link]</a></li> 
            <li>Review and comment on at least one of your classmates DB post by Sunday evening.</li>
            <li><em>**Complete and Submit Assignment 2 by Sunday evening (11:59pm).**</em> ~1 hour assuming you have completed the above activites</li> 
            <li>Once again, be sure to take some time and reward yourself for your efforts. Get a coffee and spend some time peacefully reflecting 
                on what you've accomplished. It is important to take a little time to enjoy the moment.

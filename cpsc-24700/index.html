        <h2>Web and Distributed Programming</h2>
        <h3>****Welcome to Week 1!</h3>
        <p>Welcome to week 1 of Web and Distributed Programming! I am looking forward to working with you to deliver high 
            quality Web and Internet software applications. When I have asked students from previous sessions what the like 
            most about this class and how we can improve it for future participants, the number one response I receive is 
            almost always that they enjoy delivering something practical and useful while learning the underlying philosophy 
            and theory.</p>
        <p>As such, I attempt to lead off each week with just enough technical background to get you started, provide a 
            practical (and hopefully useful &amp; interesting) project for you to pursue, and then follow-up with more details 
            on the tools and technologies that we are employing so that we can build on them in the following weeks. </p>
        <p>Even in week 1 we will be leading off with installing development tools, writing HTML, and deploying Web 
            applications even as we are learning more of the details behind our Web development technologies &amp; tools like 
            HTML, CSS, text editors, and cloud hosting. </p>
        <p>Please make every effort to join our live discussion/lecture sessions on Wednesday at noon [join.me]. Grab your 
            lunch and join us even if you can only stay for a portion of the time. I am looking forward to meeting you.
        <p>Although you are welcome to pursue our activities in any order you prefer, I am listing them in the 
            order I think will be the most beneficial for you to work through the topics. In response to feedback from previous 
            sessions I am attempting to keep your time commitment for each line item to 30 to 45 minutes unless otherwise noted.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review course Syllabus 
                <a href="syllabus-cpsc-24500-sp18-lt1.pdf" target="_blank">[pdf]</a></li>
            <li>Review Assignment 1 which is located under the "Assignments" menu item in BlackBoard. I suggest going 
                through the assignment in its entirety at the start of the week as it will give you significant insight into 
                where to focus your energy and into which topics that are most important. I would also suggest completing the 
                questions in the Assignment throughout the week as the answers can be saved. However, be <em>very</em> careful 
                not to accidentally submit the Assignment until you have completed all of the questions. If you do accidentally 
                submit the assignment, you can complete it again, but will have to re-enter <em>all</em> of your answers.</li>
            <li>Lab: If you do not already have access to a current version of Microsoft Office, install the current Microsoft 
                PowerPoint (PowerPoint Mobile) and Word (Word Mobile) viewers. I have also included a link to the Microsoft 
                store and a short video below on the topic.
